**Invasive species solution** | **AI-powered detection** | **Prototype system**

---

### What is it?  
A proof-of-concept robot system designed to:  
1. Detect invasive lionfish using AI (HuskyLens camera)  
2. Activate a solenoid "harpoon" mechanism when detected  
3. Allow manual control via joystick for positioning  

---

### Key Components  
- ü¶à **AI Detection**: HuskyLens trained to recognize lionfish  
- üéÆ **Joystick Control**: 4 motor outputs for movement/positioning  
- ‚ö° **Solenoid Activation**: Automated trigger + manual override  
- üîç **Safety Features**: Debounced button input + fail-safe motor limits  

---

### Built For  
- FLL teams exploring environmental robotics solutions  
- Demonstrating AI integration with mechanical systems  
- Prototype development for marine conservation applications
